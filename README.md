# Ultra Advanced Memecoin Token Contract

## Overview
The StacksCloutCoin Token Contract is a fungible token smart contract with manual block height handling, transfer cooldowns, staking mechanisms, and governance features. It is designed to provide a robust and decentralized financial ecosystem for a memecoin community.

## Features
- **Fungible Token Standard**: Implements a standard fungible token with symbol and supply management.
- **Manual Block Height Tracking**: Uses an internal counter for block height tracking instead of relying on an external blockchain API.
- **Transfer Cooldown**: Enforces a 10-block cooldown between transfers to prevent spam and improve security.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Users can stake tokens for a lock period based on block height.
- **Governance System**: Allows token holders to create and vote on governance proposals with explicit block height tracking.

## Contract Components

### 1. Token Configuration
- **Token Name**: `MemeToken`
- **Token Symbol**: `MEME`
- **Total Supply**: Tracks the total number of tokens issued.
- **Max Supply**: Hard-capped at `1,000,000,000` MEME.

### 2. Block Height Management
- `update-block-height`: Manually increments the block height counter.
- `get-block-height`: Reads the current block height.

### 3. Transfer Mechanism
- `transfer(amount, recipient)`: Transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient while enforcing a cooldown of 10 blocks between transfers.

### 4. Staking System
- `stake-tokens(amount, lock-period)`: Allows users to stake tokens, specifying a lock period in block height.
- `unstake-tokens()`: Allows users to unstake their tokens after the lock period has expired.

### 5. Governance System
- `create-governance-proposal(description, voting-period)`: Enables users to create governance proposals with a specified voting period.
- `vote-on-proposal(proposal-id)`: Allows users to vote on active governance proposals.

## Data Structures

### Token Tracking
```clojure
(define-fungible-token memecoin)
(define-data-var total-supply uint u0)
(define-data-var max-supply uint u1000000000)
```

### Transfer Cooldown Tracking
```clojure
(define-map transfer-last-block principal {last-transfer-block: uint})
```

### Staking Deposits
```clojure
(define-map staking-deposits principal {
  amount: uint,
  stake-block: uint,
  unlock-block: uint
})
```

### Governance Proposals
```clojure
(define-map governance-proposals {proposal-id: uint} {
  proposer: principal,
  description: (string-utf8 200),
  votes-for: uint,
  votes-against: uint,
  is-active: bool,
  proposal-block: uint,
  voting-deadline: uint
})
```

## Error Codes
- `ERR-OWNER-ONLY (u100)`: Only the contract owner can perform this action.
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE (u101)`: The sender does not have enough balance.
- `ERR-TRANSFER-COOLDOWN (u102)`: Transfer cooldown period has not expired.
- `ERR-STAKE-NOT-FOUND (u111)`: No staking record found.
- `ERR-STAKE-LOCKED (u112)`: Tokens are still locked in staking.
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND (u113)`: The specified governance proposal does not exist.
- `ERR-VOTING-CLOSED (u114)`: Voting period has ended.

## Usage Instructions

### Deploying the Contract
1. Deploy the contract to the blockchain.
2. Set initial values for token supply if necessary.

### Updating Block Height
Manually update the block height by calling:
```clojure
(update-block-height)
```

### Transferring Tokens
```clojure
(transfer amount recipient)
```
*Ensure at least 10 blocks have passed since the last transfer.*

### Staking Tokens
```clojure
(stake-tokens amount lock-period)
```
*Tokens are locked for the specified block period.*

### Unstaking Tokens
```clojure
(unstake-tokens)
```
*Ensure the unlock block height has been reached.*

### Creating a Governance Proposal
```clojure
(create-governance-proposal "Proposal Description" voting-period)
```

### Voting on a Proposal
```clojure
(vote-on-proposal proposal-id)
```
*Ensure the voting period has not ended.*

## Security Considerations
- **Block Height Manipulation**: The contract relies on manual block height updates, which must be regularly maintained.
- **Transfer Cooldown**: Prevents rapid transfers, reducing spam and bot attacks.
- **Staking Lock Period**: Ensures fairness and prevents early withdrawals.
- **Governance Transparency**: All proposals and votes are publicly recorded.

## Conclusion
The StacksCloutCoin Token Contract integrates advanced functionalities such as staking and governance while using manual block height tracking to ensure a secure and transparent system. It is designed to be a robust solution for decentralized communities looking to implement governance and staking mechanisms with a memecoin framework.
